A Python module that translates Overleaf's project history into Git
repositories. It uses RoboBrowser to navigate around the site and obtain the
correct diffs.

The module will create a subdirectory with the project file tree and Git commit
history. To convert Overleaf projects into Git repositories, simply use the
command `python -m overleaf_to_git`. After e-mail authentication, one may
choose multiple projects to be converted. The module will show progress
information as it creates commits.

Some limitations are as follows.

 (i) Binary files, as well as files that are marked as binary due to an
     empirical ~1MB diff threshold, are not tracked by Overleaf. As such,
     commits that would be empty with these files are not created.

(ii) The module purposely takes some time to construct the commits as to not
     connect to Overleaf's servers too frequently. Ergo, it may take a few
     minutes to complete execution depending on the size of the projects.
